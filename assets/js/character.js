 * parameter, and the in-built Object.assign method is 
 * used to bind this data to "this" ("this" representing 
 * the character object at the time it's created by a new 
 * instance of this class). Object.assign (takes two 
 * parameters: a target as the first parameter, and a 
 * source as the second parameter) copies properties from 
 * a source object to a target object returning a new 
 * version of the target object, and is used here to 
 * mitigate against having to repeatedly use or type

     * "currentDiceScore" of the character. The in-built JavaScript 
     * .reduce() method is used to calculate and return the total 
     * score (represented by the total of every element/number in 
     * the array) forthe character as it iterates over each element 
     * in the "attackScore" array. This method takes two arguments:
     * the first is a callback function and the second is the initial 
     * value of the operation being performed (in this case 0 as it is 
     * a calculation operation). The callback function to the .reduce()
     * method also takes two parameters (the first is a variable or
     * accumulator that is returned by the .reduce() method, and the
     * second is the current element being iterated over). The total 
     * score is then stored in the variable (or accumulator) "total"
     * and is returned and saved in the variable "totalAttackScore".
     * The "health" value for the character is then reduced by an 
     * amount equal to the "totalAttackScore". Finally, a 
     * determination is made as to whether the character is dead,
     * and in so doing ensures that the health value of the 
     * character never assumes a negative value.
