/**
 * Function to dynamically create random dice values to simulate
 * rolling the dice and will take the "diceCount" property for each
 * character object as a parameter. The "diceCount" property represents
 * the length of the newly created array. The length of the array
 * determines the number of dice each character will have. So for
 * a character with a "diceCount" property value of 3, for example, 
 * this character will have 3 dices and the purpose of this function 
 * is to generate random values for each dice. A new array that is 
 * "diceCount" in length is created with the Array constructor and 
 * filled with zeros (using the in-built JavaScript.fill() method)
 * as its initial state. The javaScript in-built .map() method 
 * (using a callback function) is then used to directly iterate 
 * over the new array and returns a random number from 1 - 6 for each 
 * element in the array.

/**

 * loads or when refreshed. This function will make it so that
 * the dice themselves only appear when the attack button is 
 * being clicked. The Array constructor is used to create a new 
 * array of length specific to the "diceCount" property of each
 * character. Each array element is assigned an initial static 
 * value (zero in this case) using the JavaScript in-built 
 * .fill() method, and then the JavaScript in-built .map() method 
 * (using a callback function) is used to iterate over the array 
 * adding the specified HTML template string representing the dice 
 * placeholder div to each element in the array. This empty div 
 * has a css class which produces the outline of the blank dice.
 * The in-built JavaScript .join() method with a separator passed 
 * in as a parameter is then used to easily create a string from
 * the resulting array and returned.
