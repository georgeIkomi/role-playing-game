# Role Playing Game

This Role Playing Game is a site that hopes to keep game lovers entertained.
In this game there are only two characters on the screen at any given time, one 
good and the other evil.

The site will be targeted towards game enthusiasts who regularly play computer
games or love participating in a role-playing game.

# Features

## Existing Features

* Character Cards

  - The character cards hold all the information relating to each character:
    name, avatar image, health, health bar, number of dice alloted, and current
    dice score.

  - This is particularly useful to the user as all the information relating to
    each character can be easily gleaned in one place.

* Health Indicator

  - The health indicator show the strength or power level that each character begins
    with at the start of the game.

  - This helps the user have some level of awarenesss as to the imminent elimination
    or otherwise of each character, as this number reduces as the character takes on
    damage inflicted by the opposing character.

* Health Bar

  - The purpose of the health bar is similar to that of the health indicator in that
    it gives an added visual awareness to the user of the state of each character's
    health or power level as the game unfolds.

  - A useful indicator to the user, the health bar of each character decreases as 
    they take on damage inflicted by the opposing character and changes colour from
    green to red when the state of the character's power level is critical.

* Dice Area

  - Characters will have between one and three dice and for every click of the attack
    button, a random number between one and six will be generated for each dice. Damage
    is inflicted on a character when the sum of the dice roll for the opposing character
    is subtracted form the character's health or power value.

  - This will enable the user to see the dice roll of each character giving them a visual
    perspective as to what is going as the game unfolds.

* Attack Button

  - The attack button is essentially what initiates commencement of the game. Each click
    of this button by the user causes a dice roll for each character and simulates the
    attack of one character on the other, and vice-versa.

  - On each click, the user will simultaneously be able to seethe change in the dice roll
    score and the resulting effect on the health or power level of the characters. This is
    beneficial as this aspect of the game is not abstracted away from the user.
