# Role Playing Game

This Role Playing Game is a site that hopes to keep game lovers entertained.
In this game there are only two characters on the screen at any given time, one 
good and the other evil.

The site will be targeted towards game enthusiasts who regularly play computer
games or love participating in a role-playing game.

# Features

## Existing Features

    * Character Cards

        - The character cards hold all the information relating to each character:
          name, avatar image, health, health bar, number of dice alloted, and current
          dice score.

        - This is particularly useful to the user as all the information relating to
          each character can be easily gleaned in one place.

    * Health Indicator

        - The health indicator show the strength or power level that each character begins
          with at the start of the game.

        - This helps the user have some level of awarenesss as to the imminent elimination
          or otherwise of each character, as this number reduces as the character takes on
          damage inflicted by the opposing character.

    * Health Bar

        - The purpose of the health bar is similar to that of the health indicator in that
          it gives an added visual awareness to the user of the state of each character's
          health or power level as the game unfolds.

        - A useful indicator to the user, the health bar of each character decreases as 
          they take on damage inflicted by the opposing character and changes colour from
          green to red when the state of the character's power level is critical.
